# AbysmalLightCompanion
A web application designed for Abysmal Light members (Destiny 2 videogame clan). Written in HTML5/Javascript, and hosted with Google Firebase Hosting.

It allowed users to create clan-only fireteams (similar to the Destiny 2 companion app by Bungie: https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Desti...), share videos and live streams, 
rank up in the in-clan rank system, and win virtual tokens tradeable for special rewards (physical and digital).
